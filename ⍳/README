'i' is just a go package. It does not run on it's own.
It does not even have a system interface (no read, write, argv...).

⍳ is the main application, one example of using 'i'.

two versions:
	go build
	go build -tags ui (still working on it…)

example:
	plot$?0i1000	(requires xterm/mintty/... with sixel graphics)
